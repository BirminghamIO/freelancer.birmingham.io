				<p>As a designer, I regularly need to hire freelance designers when things get too busy in the office. Although I have a list of designers I regularly use, it is not always up-to-date or sometimes I need designers that has other skills.</p>
				<p>I know this is not a problem I face alone, since I have been asked a few  times for recommendations from other agencies and start ups companies.</p>
				<p>So, I decided to create this list to make it easier for companies to find design freelancers.</p>
				<h3>This website is under development</h3>
				<p>This website was built as a Minimal Viable Product. I want to test it to see if it is going to be actually useful to other people before spending more time on it.</p>
