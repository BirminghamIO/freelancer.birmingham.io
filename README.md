### Want to make changes?

Our fork of this project uses [Jeykll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to share the layout between the pages. Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed, you should be able to run these commands to get your own version running locally.

    git clone git@github.com:BirminghamIO/freelancer.birmingham.io.git
    cd freelancer.birmingham.io/
    bundle install
    jekyll serve

Providing that worked, you should now be able to preview your changes here: [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)
